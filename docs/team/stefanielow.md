## Project: TraceYourProj

### Overview 
TraceYourProj is a quick and simple application for tracking online resources for data science projects, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Features implemented

* **Feature 1**: Added an edit command.
    * <i>What it does</i> : Allows user to edit the url or/and description of a resource in the resource list. 
    * <i>Justification</i> : This feature improves the product significantly as it provides the user with greater convenience 
    in changing the url/ description of a resource. Without this feature, to change the url/ description of a resource, 
      user has to delete the resource first, and then add it back to the resource list again with the new url/description.
    By permitting easy update to a resource's url/description, the edit command provides greater flexibility
      and relieves anxiety of user in making typo errors.
      

* **Feature 2**: Added a delete command
    * <i>What it does</i> : Allows user to delete a specific resource from a project or the entire project.
    * <i>Justification</i> : This feature improves the product significantly because it allows user to remove
      resources, that are no longer relevant, from the resource list. It enables users to clean the resource list and
      free up memory space by removing unnecessary resources.  
     

* Wrote JUnit tests related to `delete` and `edit` functions
