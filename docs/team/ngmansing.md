#### Features implemented

* **Feature 1**: Added an add command.
    * <i>What it does</i> : Allows user to add a resource to a project.
    * <i>Justification</i> : This feature is a fundamental command of the product that is for users to add a resource to
  the target project.

* **Feature 2**: Added data feature implicitly
  * <i>What it does</i> : Updates the last modified data when the resource is added or edited
  * <i>Justification</i> : This feature improves the product significantly because it updates the last modified dates 
    automatically when a resource is added or edited such that users could know when they have created/modified 
    resources.
